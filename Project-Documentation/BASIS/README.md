## Purpose
The pursose of this development project is to produce a user interface to the BASIS data program, a region-wide data collection, storage and sharing initiative being undertaken by MTC. The interface will act as the main means of interaction that users will have with regional datasets, allowing them to view, update or delete datasets based on their level of authorization. In addition, the application will provide the means for visualizing datasets through interactive visualization tools such as maps and charts, allowing for data exploration and analysis. 


## Description
The Bay Area Spatial Information System (BASIS) is a new Data as a Service (DaaS) Initiative operated by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). Managed by the Data and Visualization Team, a unit within the Regional Planning Program (RPP), this system will bring key regional datasets onto an industry standard DaaS platform where users internal and external to ABAG/MTC can download it, or access it via API for analysis and modeling purposes. BASIS represents an evolution of past efforts, such as the Local Policy Development Survey (2005), that sought to collect data from local jurisdictions for use in regional forecasts, and long range planning activities for the nine county San Francisco Bay Area region.

## Environment
Javascript frameworks are used both for the front-end user interface and the server-side code. [A full stack generator](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack) was used for initial scaffolding
